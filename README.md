# emacs.d

## How to install

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbpark/emacs.d/master/install.sh | $SHELL
```

The required emacs packages will be automatically installed when running Emacs after the installation.

[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the version >= 25 must be installed. Check the version of Emacs `emacs --version` in a shell or `M-x emacs-version` in Emacs before installing this. [Aspell](http://aspell.net) and its dictionary are recommended to be installed, but not required.
